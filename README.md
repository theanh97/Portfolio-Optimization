Portfolio Optimization of Major Tech Stocks: Markowitz, Sharpe Ratio, VaR & CAPM

This project implements a stochastic approach to investment portfolio optimization using key performance indicators (KPIs) and financial models to maximize the Return/Risk Ratio (RRR). The focus is on constructing and comparing the following portfolios for major tech growth stocks (NVDA, META, AMZN, AAPL):

	•	Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
	•	Min Value at Risk (VaR) Portfolio
	•	Min Volatility Portfolio

Key Features

	•	Markowitz Efficient Frontier: Utilizing historical data to construct optimal portfolios.
	•	Monte Carlo Simulations: Generating random portfolios to identify optimal asset allocations.
	•	CAPM Line Analysis: Calculating Alpha and Beta for monthly returns.
	•	Data Visualization: Plotting efficient frontiers, VaR, and Sharpe ratios for easy interpretation.
